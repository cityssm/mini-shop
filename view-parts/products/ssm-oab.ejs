    Planning a small fire? The
    <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/070213" target="_blank"
      >Ontario Fire Code</a
    >
    requires that all open-air burning must be approved by Fire Services.
  </p>

  <p>
    Open-air burning permits can be obtained online at any time using the form
    below. You may also contact Fire Services at 705-949-3333 ext. 3 Monday to
    Friday between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. to arrange for a burning permit.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before a new permit can be issued, a Fire Prevention Officer will perform a
    site inspection (a non-refundable inspection fee applies), at which time
    conditions for approval will be reviewed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Approval guidelines address such issues as material to be burned, distances
    from structures and combustible materials, weather conditions, and so on.
    Someone must stay with the fire at all times until it is completely
    extinguished and equipment must be available to extinguish the fire in the
    event that it gets out of control or is causing an adverse effect.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sault Fire Services has recently added a significant condition to the
    open-air burning permit process. A permit will not be issued unless the
    homeowner agrees to allow the Fire Prevention Officer to check the home's
    smoke alarm.
  </p>
  <p>
    If smoke alarms are working and all other terms of approval have been met,
    an open-air burning permit is issued. Once the permit expires, it is the
    owner's responsibility to renew the permit, which, in most instances, may be
    done over the telephone or through this website. (Call 705-949-3333 ext. 3
    to renew an existing permit.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Obtaining authorization to have an open-air fire does not relieve an owner
    from the obligation to comply with the
    <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90e19" target="_blank"
      >Environmental Protection Act of Ontario</a
    >. While burning, there is an obligation to ensure that smoke does not
    interfere with the ability of neighbours to enjoy their properties.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tenants are reminded that written approval from the homeowner will be
    required prior to issuance of a burning permit for rented properties.

<h2 class="title is-4">Open-Air Burning Guidelines</h2>

<div class="content">
  <p>
    The following guidelines are to be strictly adhered to by a person or
    persons doing the burning. Fire Services takes a "Zero Tolerance" approach
    to any violation of these approvals.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Open-air burning shall not be permitted unless approved.</li>
    <li>Burning must cease prior to 11 p.m.</li>
    <li>
      Burn only dry material. All other material such as petroleum products,
      plastics, rubber, painted lumber etc., that will cause excessive smoke or
      fumes
      <strong style="text-transform: uppercase">must not be burned</strong>.
      Mixed demolition debris is not suitable for open-air burning.
    </li>
    <li>
      Keep the fire at an approved distance from any structure and/or any
      combustible material (trees, grass, woodpiles, etc.).
    </li>
    <li>Burn less than 1 cubic metre of material at a time.</li>
    <li>
      Stay with the fire at all times until it is completely extinguished.
    </li>
    <li>
      Equipment and resources must be available at the burning site to
      extinguish the fire, in the event that the fire gets out of control or is
      causing an adverse effect.
    </li>
    <li>
      Open-air burning must not be conducted during rain or fog (smoke cannot
      disperse properly), and when wind speeds are high or wind direction
      changes frequently (fire may spread rapidly).
    </li>
    <li>
      Common courtesy for your neighbours is expected (i.e. clotheslines, open
      window, etc.). If we receive a complaint, Fire Services must respond. If
      the complaint is deemed legitimate, the permit will be cancelled for 90
      days and/or charges will be laid under the
      <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/97f04" target="_blank"
        >Fire Protection and Prevention Act</a
      >.
    </li>
    <li>
      Open-air burning will not be approved for Industrial or Commercial
      occupancies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Obtaining authorization to have an open-air fire does not relieve an owner
      from the obligation to comply with the
      <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90e19" target="_blank"
        >Environmental Protection Act of Ontario</a
      >.
    </li>
    <li>
      Tenants are reminded that written approval from the homeowner will be
      required prior to issuance of a burning permit for rented properties.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p style="text-transform: uppercase">
    Open-air burning is approved under the above noted rules. Any contravention
    of these rules will result in an immediate 90 day suspension of the permit
    and/or prosecution under the Ontario Fire Code and Fire Protection and
    Prevention Act.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whenever the Ministry of Natural Resources has a ban on burning, all permits
    in Sault Ste. Marie are cancelled until such time that the ban has been
    lifted.
